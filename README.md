Full details of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/REYD-TTS)

If you want to generate samples without hassle, there is a interactive demo available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xv0I_auaZ9rdNMMyrBpJHvOotH9w_BHa?usp=sharing)

The original README of the FastSpeech 2 implementation is appended below our Yiddish-specific instructions

## Setup

In order to run training or inference you will need to install the necessary dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Depending on your system you may need to delete the version numbers to get things to install smoothly. You should ensure you have a version of PyTorch with CUDA enabled for training. You will also need the `yiddish` library from Isaac Bleaman

```
pip install yiddish
```
Download pretrained models and pre-processed dataset

```
wget --content-disposition https://figshare.com/ndownloader/articles/19350539/versions/1
unzip 19350539.zip
```

## Training (Yiddish)

We provide a pre-processed version of our dataset. This consists of
- alignment TextGrids generated using the Montreal Forced Aligner. See [here](https://github.com/REYD-TTS/yiddish-tts-texts)
- FastSpeech2 specific pre-processing steps (generating spectrograms etc.) See preprocessing section below

Move the relevant files from setup section

```
mv yiddish_textgrids*.zip preprocessed_data/
for orthography in 'yivo_respelled' 'yivo_original' 'hasidic'; do unzip preprocessed_data/yiddish_textgrids_${orthography}.zip; done
```

There are three different orthographies available. For more information about these see the paper.
```
export orthography=yivo_respelled # yivo_original hasidic
```
Run the training script

```
python train.py -p config/${orthography}/preprocess.yaml -m config/${orthography}/model.yaml -t config/${orthography}/train.yaml
```

## Synthesis

For synthesis we provide pretrained models, which are downloaded as part of the set-up section.

Move these to the right place as below. If you have trained your own, this will not be needed.

```
unzip pretrained_models.zip
for orthography in 'yivo_respelled' 'yivo_original' 'hasidic'
do
    mkdir -p output/ckpt/${orthography}
    mkdir -p output/log/${orthography}
    mkdir -p output/result/${orthography}
    mv ${orthography}/100000.pth.tar output/ckpt/${orthography}/
    rm -rf ${orthography}/
done
```

Speaker ids are 0: male, Lithuanian Yiddish, 1: female, Lithuanian Yiddish, 2: male, Polish Yiddish.
Orthography is as above.

```
export s_id=0 # 1 2
export orthography=yivo_respelled # yivo_original hasidic
```

Set your text input

```
export text="מעקט אָפּ דעם טעקסט און שרײַבט אַרײַן אַן אײגענעם"
```

Preprocess input text (See paper)

```
text=$(python yiddish_preprocessing.py ${text} -o ${orthography})
```

Run inference script

```
python synthesize.py --text \"{text}\" --speaker_id ${s_id} --restore_step 100000 --mode single -p config/${othography}/preprocess.yaml -m config/${orthography}/model.yaml -t config/${orthography}/train.yaml

ls output/result/${orthography}
```

# FastSpeech 2 - PyTorch Implementation

This is a PyTorch implementation of Microsoft's text-to-speech system [**FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558v1). 
This project is based on [xcmyz's implementation](https://github.com/xcmyz/FastSpeech) of FastSpeech. Feel free to use/modify the code.

There are several versions of FastSpeech 2.
This implementation is more similar to [version 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558v1), which uses F0 values as the pitch features.
On the other hand, pitch spectrograms extracted by continuous wavelet transform are used as the pitch features in the [later versions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558).

# Updates
- 2021/7/8: Release the checkpoint and audio samples of a multi-speaker English TTS model trained on LibriTTS
- 2021/2/26: Support English and Mandarin TTS
- 2021/2/26: Support multi-speaker TTS (AISHELL-3 and LibriTTS)
- 2021/2/26: Support MelGAN and HiFi-GAN vocoder

# Audio Samples
Audio samples generated by this implementation can be found [here](https://ming024.github.io/FastSpeech2/). 

# Quickstart

## Dependencies
You can install the Python dependencies with
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

You have to download the [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DOhZGlTLMbbAAFZmZGDdc77kz1PloS7F?usp=sharing) and put them in ``output/ckpt/LJSpeech/``,  ``output/ckpt/AISHELL3``, or ``output/ckpt/LibriTTS/``.

For English single-speaker TTS, run
```
python3 synthesize.py --text "YOUR_DESIRED_TEXT" --restore_step 900000 --mode single -p config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml -m config/LJSpeech/model.yaml -t config/LJSpeech/train.yaml
```

For Mandarin multi-speaker TTS, try
```
python3 synthesize.py --text "大家好" --speaker_id SPEAKER_ID --restore_step 600000 --mode single -p config/AISHELL3/preprocess.yaml -m config/AISHELL3/model.yaml -t config/AISHELL3/train.yaml
```

For English multi-speaker TTS, run
```
python3 synthesize.py --text "YOUR_DESIRED_TEXT"  --speaker_id SPEAKER_ID --restore_step 800000 --mode single -p config/LibriTTS/preprocess.yaml -m config/LibriTTS/model.yaml -t config/LibriTTS/train.yaml
```

The generated utterances will be put in ``output/result/``.

Here is an example of synthesized mel-spectrogram of the sentence "Printing, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned, differs from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the Exhibition", with the English single-speaker TTS model.

## Batch Inference
Batch inference is also supported, try

```
python3 synthesize.py --source preprocessed_data/LJSpeech/val.txt --restore_step 900000 --mode batch -p config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml -m config/LJSpeech/model.yaml -t config/LJSpeech/train.yaml
```
to synthesize all utterances in ``preprocessed_data/LJSpeech/val.txt``

## Controllability
The pitch/volume/speaking rate of the synthesized utterances can be controlled by specifying the desired pitch/energy/duration ratios.
For example, one can increase the speaking rate by 20 % and decrease the volume by 20 % by

```
python3 synthesize.py --text "YOUR_DESIRED_TEXT" --restore_step 900000 --mode single -p config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml -m config/LJSpeech/model.yaml -t config/LJSpeech/train.yaml --duration_control 0.8 --energy_control 0.8
```

# Training

## Datasets

The supported datasets are

- [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/): a single-speaker English dataset consists of 13100 short audio clips of a female speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books, approximately 24 hours in total.
- [AISHELL-3](http://www.aishelltech.com/aishell_3): a Mandarin TTS dataset with 218 male and female speakers, roughly 85 hours in total.
- [LibriTTS](https://research.google/tools/datasets/libri-tts/): a multi-speaker English dataset containing 585 hours of speech by 2456 speakers.

We take LJSpeech as an example hereafter.

## Preprocessing
 
First, run 
```
python3 prepare_align.py config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml
```
for some preparations.

As described in the paper, [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (MFA) is used to obtain the alignments between the utterances and the phoneme sequences.
Alignments of the supported datasets are provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DBRkALpPd6FL9gjHMmMEdHODmkgNIIK4?usp=sharing).
You have to unzip the files in ``preprocessed_data/LJSpeech/TextGrid/``.

After that, run the preprocessing script by
```
python3 preprocess.py config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml
```

Alternately, you can align the corpus by yourself. 
Download the official MFA package and run
```
./montreal-forced-aligner/bin/mfa_align raw_data/LJSpeech/ lexicon/librispeech-lexicon.txt english preprocessed_data/LJSpeech
```
or
```
./montreal-forced-aligner/bin/mfa_train_and_align raw_data/LJSpeech/ lexicon/librispeech-lexicon.txt preprocessed_data/LJSpeech
```

to align the corpus and then run the preprocessing script.
```
python3 preprocess.py config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml
```

## Training

Train your model with
```
python3 train.py -p config/LJSpeech/preprocess.yaml -m config/LJSpeech/model.yaml -t config/LJSpeech/train.yaml
```

The model takes less than 10k steps (less than 1 hour on my GTX1080Ti GPU) of training to generate audio samples with acceptable quality, which is much more efficient than the autoregressive models such as Tacotron2.

# TensorBoard

Use
```
tensorboard --logdir output/log/LJSpeech
```

to serve TensorBoard on your localhost.
The loss curves, synthesized mel-spectrograms, and audios are shown.

# Implementation Issues

- Following [xcmyz's implementation](https://github.com/xcmyz/FastSpeech), I use an additional Tacotron-2-styled Post-Net after the decoder, which is not used in the original FastSpeech 2.
- Gradient clipping is used in the training.
- In my experience, using phoneme-level pitch and energy prediction instead of frame-level prediction results in much better prosody, and normalizing the pitch and energy features also helps. Please refer to ``config/README.md`` for more details.

Please inform me if you find any mistakes in this repo, or any useful tips to train the FastSpeech 2 model.
